# Configuration

Use `configs/local.json` only for stable local environment values and fallback defaults. It is ignored by Git. Keep `configs/example.json` reusable and free of credentials. Pass changing request values through `--request-json`; do not edit a file for every lesson.

## Per-run input

Pass a compact JSON object as one shell-quoted argument:

```bash
npm run milestone1 -- --config configs/local.json --request-json '{"sourceFolderPath":["Courses","! My Courses","! Sample & Orientation Lessons"],"sourceLessonTitle":"[Jss] TEST LESSON A 280826","destinationFolderPath":["Courses","! My Courses","! Sample & Orientation Lessons"],"lessonTitle":"[Jss-Skill] TEST LESSON B 280826"}'
```

The scripts merge these permitted request values in memory and derive `destinationFolder` from `destinationFolderPath` when omitted. They reject attempts to override stable `baseUrl`, `workspaceCourse`, browser settings, or selectors.

## Copy fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `baseUrl` | Stable LAMS entry URL; keep in local configuration |
| `workspaceCourse` | Stable safety boundary; must remain exactly `DL Playground 2026/2027 [internal]` |
| `sourceFolderPath` | Ordered folder names leading to the source lesson |
| `sourceLessonTitle` | Exact existing lesson title |
| `destinationFolderPath` | Ordered folder names for the new copy |
| `createDestinationFolder` | Optional explicit permission to create only the missing final path segment |
| `lessonTitle` | Exact new copy title |
| `previousCohort`, `currentCohort`, `module`, `tbl` | Optional prompt-derived overrides when the request supplies them |
| `destinationFolder` | Human-readable destination used in reporting |

Folder paths are variable-length arrays. Do not assume a fixed number of folders.

When `createDestinationFolder` is true, `destinationFolderPath` must contain a parent path and exact final folder name. The workflow refuses to create intermediate folders, refuses an existing final folder, and refuses a read-only parent.

## Validation fields

`expectedFlow` contains the exact node names in their expected linear order. Do not populate it from the observed graph merely to make validation pass.

`expectedAENodes` and `expectedAEGates` are manual expectations. Source-of-Truth parsing is not part of this skill version.

Use `expectedGateProperties` for exact gate requirements:

```json
{
  "expectedGateProperties": [
    {
      "name": "iRAT Gate",
      "type": "password",
      "description": "iRAT Gate",
      "dynamicPassword": true,
      "rotationSeconds": 10
    },
    {
      "name": "tRAT Gate",
      "type": "permission",
      "description": "tRAT Gate"
    }
  ]
}
```

Every property except `name` is optional. Only add an expectation when it came from the user's request or an established workflow rule.

## Browser fields

Keep `headless` false during development. Store the persistent profile only under ignored `.playwright/`. The user completes authentication manually when needed.

For read-only AE inspection, `selectors.aeOpenActivity` is a stable local-environment selector for the Open control shown after selecting one exact AE SVG node. Discover it from authenticated DOM diagnostics; do not infer it from the training video. Keep it in ignored `configs/local.json`, not per-run JSON.

## Structured AE preflight input

Pass the local path separately with `--ae-json`; do not merge AE question content into `--request-json`. Use `configs/ae-example.json` as the schema example. Required fields are:

- `sourceLabel`, `breakMarkerCount`, non-empty `nodes`, and `gates`;
- exact node titles and globally sequential question numbers;
- `mcq` or `essay` question type, prompt text, and MCQ options with exactly one `correct: true`;
- exact gate title, adjacent node titles, and the first question number after each gate.

`marks` defaults to 4. `attempts` defaults to 1 and `passingMark` to null; supply them only when the SoT explicitly overrides those defaults. `expectedTotalMarks` is optional but recommended.

## Configuration checks

Before running a committed copy, reject the merged request when:

- the new title equals the source title;
- the new title contains a placeholder;
- a source or destination path is empty;
- the source lesson or destination is not exact;
- the destination already contains the new title;
- the workspace course differs from the approved playground.
